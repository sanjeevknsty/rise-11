I have successfully completed the project by following the outlined steps. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

Frontend
Framework: React.js

I used React.jsto build the user interface, creating reusable components to ensure efficient state management and a seamless user experience.

UI Library: Material UI

I integrated Material UI to implement Google's Material Design principles, providing a consistent and visually appealing UI.

Responsive Design

I ensured the dashboard works across desktop, tablet, and mobile views by using Material UI's Grid component and CSS media queries for a flexible grid layout.
Components:

Sidebar Navigation: Implemented a vertical menu for easy navigation between Dashboard, Orders, Customers, Menu, and Settings.

Cards for KPIs: Created card components to display key performance indicators such as Visitors, Orders, Earnings, and Satisfaction.

Charts: Used Chart.jsto create interactive charts for displaying profit trends and popular time slots.

Tables/Lists: Displayed user ratings and liked/disliked dishes in table and list components.

Forms: Developed forms for input fields, including a profit calculator.

Functionalities:

Interactive Charts: Implemented interactive charts with Chart.js, allowing users to hover over data points to see tooltips.

Hover Effects and Tooltips: Added hover effects and tooltips to enhance user experience.

Filtering and Sorting: Implemented filtering and sorting options for user ratings and menu items.
Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
Framework: Node.jswith Express

Built the server-side application using Node.jsand Express, ensuring scalability and efficiency.

Database: MongoDB

Used MongoDB to store data in JSON-like documents, providing flexibility and scalability.

API Development:

Endpoints:

/api/orders: Created endpoints to retrieve, add, update, and delete orders.

/api/customers: Developed endpoints to manage customer data.

/api/menu: Added endpoints to add/update menu items.

/api/dashboard: Implemented endpoints to return dashboard stats (visitors, orders, profits).

Authentication:

Used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access to API endpoints, ensuring data security.

Data Models:

User Model: Defined fields such as name, email, and role.

Order Model: Included fields such as items, totalAmount, customer, and date.

Customer Model: Added fields such as name, contact, and orders.

Menu Model: Included fields such as dishName, category, price, and popularity.

Connected the React frontend with the Node.js/Expressbackend using REST APIs, making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the defined endpoints.


Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing orders, customers, and menu items, allowing users to interact with the data.

Deployed the React application on Vercel, taking advantage of features like automatic scaling, custom domains, and continuous deployment.
